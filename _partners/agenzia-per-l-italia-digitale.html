	The Agency for Digital Italy (Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale) is a
	Government agency responsible for the implementation of the Italian
	Digital Agenda under the surveillance of the Presidency of the Council of
	Ministers. Since June 2012 the Agency has replaced the former e-Government
	agency (DigitPA), the Department for Digitization and Innovation and the
	Agency for the Promotion of Technology Innovation. The Agency supports
	public administrations in their effective use of ICT, improving quality of
	services and reducing costs.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
	AgID has broad competences in e-Government, information society and
	technology innovation, including such areas as new generation networks,
	security, open standards, digital literacy, open data, digital inclusion,
	smart communities and digital health and education. The Agency promote
	e-Government by providing support at the legislative, policy-making and
	implementation levels and by defining regulations and criteria for the
	design, implementation and management of public information systems.

	It also defines criteria and technical rules on ICT security,
	interoperability and performance. As the former DigitPA, the new Agency
	maintains <em>Sistema Pubblico di Connettività</em> (SPC), a general
	architectural framework to provide central and local administration with
	shared network and application services, which is consistent with the
	European Interoperability Strategy and Framework. The Agency has published
	guide-lines on the adoption of cloud services by public administrations
	that paved the way to further initiatives in data center consolidation and
	provision of vertical and horizontal cloud services to the public sector.
	Within its scope, the Agency is the national reference authority for
	European and international relations and promotes a wider participation to
	European programs and initiatives.
